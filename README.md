# string_template_py.py
string_template_py.py is a simple python code for having templates stand in for strings.
example say, you create a word document with text as follows:
'my name is R, and I am 12 years'

we can create a template such that
'my name is $name, and I am $age years'

we can also import data set to fill in such string template and create a new word document or text file for each.

the aim is to automate the boring and tedious stuff ;)
